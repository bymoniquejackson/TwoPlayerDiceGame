<header>A little dice game for two!</header>

<intro>Choose which one of you would like to be player one. This player will go first. The "current" box will show your current score as the dice has been rolled. <br>Once a certain number is reached, player one may choose to keep their score. This will then appear in the middle of player ones section as their total score. <br> Player one will no longer be able to roll. Now it is player two's turn to roll.  Same rules apply.  If a player hits the number one withought holding any score,<br> the current score will reset.  Once once player reaches 20 or more, they win. Have fun!<br></intro>
